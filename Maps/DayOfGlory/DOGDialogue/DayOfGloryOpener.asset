  - 'The Empire of Altgard has always followed ambition. Even in the darkest of nights,
    ambition was its guiding light, allowing them to rise against oppression, above
    strife, and toward a better future.  '
  - 'And on this night, you follow this great empire on yet another one of its many
    ambitions. To claim Maukland, and defeat the Dynasty of Zhanguo, whom you know
    as Atlesia. '
  - "The gods\u2019 smiles take the form of a thousand stars shining above the battlefield.
    After initially severe setbacks and losses, minor victories are starting to be
    won in skirmishes all along the Grafton River. "
  - "Altgard\u2019s day of glory is fast approaching. You stand amongst your compatriots,
    beholding the oblivious Atlesian host as their campfires, palisades, and tents
    cover the valley.  "
