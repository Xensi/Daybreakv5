  - 'You see heavy movement in the distance. An enemy army? Your soldiers ready themselves
    for combat. '
  - "As the force draws closer, it becomes clear that there\u2019s no real cause
    for alarm. These are soldiers armed with abacuses and silver tongues.\r\n"
  - "Merchants. A whole caravan of them.\r"
  - "A woman leading the caravan draws near. She gives you a quick, calculated glance
    up and down, seemingly appraising your potential as a customer.\r"
  - She has a serious look in her eyes, and a plastered-on smile.
  - Salutations, Altgardians. An army on the march I see? As soldiers, you need all
    manner of things. Supplies, food, horses . . . all of which I could provide!
    For a price, of course. Would you like to peruse my wares?
