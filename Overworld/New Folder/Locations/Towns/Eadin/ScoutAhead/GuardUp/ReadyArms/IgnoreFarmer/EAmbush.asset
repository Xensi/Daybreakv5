  sentences:
  - A swarm of bolts rises out of the fields, and your conscripts and soldiers cry
    out a mix of warnings and foul language. Those lucky enough to hold shields just
    barely manage to block the heavy force of the projectiles. Some are not so lucky.
  - Your horse is startled and rears back, nearly throwing you off. As you call out
    orders to assemble into battle, you now see the wide brimmed hat and cloak of
    the farmer seemingly morph before your eyes.
  - Armor. A staff, and a plumed helmet. Foreign battle cries ring out from both
    sides of the road as the trap is sprung.
