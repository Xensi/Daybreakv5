  - "Without hesitation, Gotfried, with the help of another soldier, forcibly bind
    the man\u2019s hands behind his back. He is dragged kicking and screeching towards
    the shire-reeve and his posse, who in turn lock him away in the town\u2019s gaol
    to await sentencing."
  - "After some time, the Mauklings return. \r\n"
  - "Your support in ending this thief\u2019s tomfoolery is much appreciated, good
    sir. "
  - "We don\u2019t have much, but we hope some of our supplies and horses will do
    you some good in the coming battles. I\u2019ll make sure to get you some of the
    best in our stock. "
  - "Oh, and a fair word of warning before you depart. The Atlesians are now ranging
    farther and farther from their stronghold. And come to think of it, we haven\u2019t
    heard from Eadin in a few days . . ."
