  sentences:
  - 'Heading south of Peatmyre, the roads become mushier, the soil loose. A fetid
    stench wafts from ahead, and you can see the gnarled mangroves and murky waters
    of the bogs. '
  - 'This part of the bogs is much too difficult to cross. And if I recall the maps
    correctly, we are at the edge of the Sunless Mere. I doubt that much of anything
    awaits us here. '
  - "You acknowledge Ingva\u2019s advice, and consider turning around. But before
    you do, a lone table blocking the patchy road sits ahead of you. \r\n"
  - 'As you approach, you see that a lone man sits on the far end of the table. About
    his back is a tattered cloak. A curled, gray beard dangles from his chin, and
    a small cluster of grapes lies on a wooden plate before him. He beckons you to
    approach.

'
  - "You dismount. Upon getting a closer look, you notice that he has a\u2026crown?
    Of twigs, small branches, leaves and grass atop his head. You suppose that it
    would make for a comfy bird\u2019s nest. "
  - "\rThe man begins to speak.\r\n"
  - Welcome to my domain, travelers. You may call me . . . the Emperor.
  - Emperor?
  - Yes, the Emperor. Emperor of all of Maukland.
  - "<i>Pfft.</i> Right. And I\u2019m the Kaiser of Altgard."
  - Ah, so from one monarch to another, I invite you to dine with me.
  - "He considers the Emperor\u2019s words for a second."
  - Ah, why not I suppose.
  - "You and the rest of your personal retinue sit at the table, while the rest of
    your forces stop at the roadside for some respite. You break out some crusty
    bread as today\u2019s dish of choice.\r"
  - You decide to question this . . . Emperor.
