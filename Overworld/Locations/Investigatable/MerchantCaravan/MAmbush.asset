  - "Ah, I\u2019m real sorry about that. We couldn\u2019t. The Atlesians strong-armed
    us into hiding, so that we wouldn\u2019t ruin their plans. Getting killed is
    bad for business, you know."
  - "These Atlesians . . . they\u2019re a nasty sort, aren\u2019t they? I nearly
    thought they were going to rob us of all we had."
  - "Say, I\u2019ve got a bargain for you, commander. How about we follow your army?"
  - "You\u2019ve got exclusive trading rights, as long as you can protect us from
    those scoundrels. How about it?"
