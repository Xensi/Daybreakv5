  - "Do not be distracted by old stones and rusted blades. What\u2019s new, the Mauklings
    have abandoned forts? Our great Empire has ruins many times this size, so I am
    hardly impressed!"
  - 'We cannot linger here long. I have no doubts that battles raged here in ages
    long past . . . and perhaps the warriors have not left their posts, still manning
    them as shades. '
  - These ruins . . . they stand as a testament to how the Kingdom of Maukland has
    fallen. Without our guidance, all of Maukland would resemble this ruin. So take
    heart, and take this as a reminder of our righteous cause!
