  sentences:
  - 'As you and your forces march onwards, you happen across the forlorn ruins of
    an old garrison. The lone pillars of stone stretch out of the wind-battered soil,
    like the fingers of a skeletal hand. '
  - "Moss-covered pools of water congeal in what might\u2019ve been old baths or
    aqueducts. The garrison itself seems to have one half collapsed into rubble,
    the other standing alone. Your troops take a moment to marvel at the desolate
    sight."
  - 'The usually loudmouthed Gotfried is humbled into silence by the ruins. '
  - With a new land comes new mysteries . . . I once heard Maukling villagers tell

  - 'Goodness. No sense of romance, this one. '
  - 'You ruminate on this place for but a moment and say:'
