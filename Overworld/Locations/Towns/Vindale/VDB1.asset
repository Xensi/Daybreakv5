  sentences:
  - "Two of your soldiers stride forward, raising their halberds to aim their tips
    at the old man\u2019s throat. They stand ready to skewer him at a moment\u2019s
    notice. The once quiet villagers now cry out in fear, and Hartwig looks at you
    with some measure of concern. "
  - A desperate shout calls out from a nearby hovel. A somewhat bulky man staggers
    out. He looks to be a butcher, though his apron does not seem stained with the
    blood of beasts. You see a terrified woman urge him not to go, but he meets your
    gaze regardless.
  - "Stop! Stop this, please! Yes, I slit your messenger\u2019s throat, it was I!
    Spare the old man your wrath!"
  - "So, you are the miscreant responsible for our messenger\u2019s death. For what
    reason have you done this? "
  - "\rHe points his sword in accusation. \r\n"
  - "\rThe butcher fearfully collapses to his knees before you, explaining himself
    in ragged breaths. \r\n"
  - "I loathed the idea of your rule. To squirm beneath your boot, to bow to your
    perverse creed . . . I thought I was better off dead. But you needn\u2019t have
    these others pay for my mistakes. "
  - Our rule!? For what reason? We bring salvation, light, liberation!
  - Those who fell at Etterhall would like to say otherwise.
  - Etterhall? What in the stars of KSH are you talking about . . .
  - "Your companion\u2019s brows scrunch in confusion and aggravation. Gotfried regards
    the culprit with nothing but a cold gaze, and remains silent. Even the normally
    stoic Ingva seems perturbed . . . her eyes widen at the word \u201CEtterhall.\u201D "
  - You swing up off your steed and approach the thief to decide his fate, and that
    of his compatriots.
