  sentences:
  - 'Upon entering the small town of Vindale, the business of village life comes
    to a screeching halt. The reactions of the Mauklings have always bewildered you.
    They normally approach you with apprehension, despite you being their liberators. '
  - 'But today is different. Today, the normally squalling children hide in their
    hovels. The grimy workmen do not attend their toils. They do not even approach
    to so much as greet you. It becomes clear why when you reach the town center. '
  - 'A delegate, a messenger it seems, lies sprawled across the ground in broad daylight.
    Gnats nibble his pale flesh. Drawn blood oozes across the ground from an opening
    in his neck. Hartwig shakes his head in concern. '
  - "\u201CAre the villagers responsible for this?\u201D\r\n"
