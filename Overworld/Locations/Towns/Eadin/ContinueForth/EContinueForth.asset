  - 'As you continue forth on the winding path, the wind sends a chill breeze through
    your ranks. Fluttering songbirds chirrup as they bob and weave past you. The
    scene feels almost serene. '
  - 'But before you can catch a breath in this moment of calm, the silence is shattered.
    A volley of bolts cuts through the air with a harsh whistle. Some of the soldiers
    around you block the projectiles with their shields, those who are not as lucky
    are quickly felled. '
  - Damn it! An ambush!
  - You hastily call your troops into position.
  - "I see more enemy forces streaming out of the wheat fields to our north and the
    brush to our south. They\u2019ve caught us in a pincer. "
  - "No shit\u2014\n<i>A bolt whizzes past him and lodges itself in a nearby conscript\u2019s
    shield.\r</i>"
