  sentences:
  - "Your bowmen react swiftly. A barrage of arrows fall around the \u201Cfarmer.\u201D
    The arrows don\u2019t seem to fell him, but he does lunge backwards. You now
    see the wide brimmed hat and cloak of the farmer seemingly morph before your
    eyes. Armor. A staff, and a plumed helmet."
  - "The arrows find marks you didn\u2019t expect them to hit, and yelps of pain
    and foreign curses ring out, as the field comes alive with dozens of Atlesian
    soldiers rising to do battle. The light shimmers and distorts before you in an
    odd, wavy pattern, like on a hot summer\u2019s day."
  - Would it have killed either of you to explain that you thought he was an Atlesian?
  - Apologies. Instinct. Had to think on our feet. Speaking of which . . . volley
    incoming!
  - 'Several soldiers lift shields and huddle into formation as you prepare for battle. '
