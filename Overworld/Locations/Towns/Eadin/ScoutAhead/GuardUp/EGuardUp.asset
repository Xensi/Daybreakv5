  sentences:
  - You could be right. Perhaps it could be banditry? But then why would they discard
    the treasure like that . . . Either way, it pays to be cautious.
  - 'We might not run into any trouble, but just in case, it may be prudent to have
    the men ready themselves. Have soldiers don armor, string bows, the works.

'
  - Yes, but that will take some time. Keep in mind that whilst we sit on our laurels
    readying our weapons, any would-be ambushers would see a prime opportunity.
  - "We could retreat, if you\u2019d like.\r\n<i>Gotfried frowns and gives Hartwig
    a look, offended by the notion.\r</i>"
