  sentences:
  - From afar, Eadin shows little signs of activity. Songbirds circle overhead, darting
    back and forth between scatterings of trees. If it were not for the odd figure
    tending to a field or emerging from a hut, you would have assumed it was mostly
    abandoned. It is a fair distance down the road.
  - The town is awfully silent. Perhaps the war has driven the locals away?
  - "The Atlesians wouldn\u2019t dare raid so close to Fenton. Unless they\u2019ve
    gotten bolder. In which case, a bit of retaliation might be in order. \r\n<i>Gotfried
    cracks his knuckles.</i>\n"
  - "I suppose it\u2019d be prudent to greet their shire-reeve, or local lord. Or
    whoever leads them."
  - "The place looks dour enough that I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the villagers
    just up and left because they hated the place. <i>Hrm.</i> This far away and
    I can smell the manure . . .\n<i>He winces in disgust.</i>"
  - I mistrust the silence. I feel as if some sort of ambush awaits us, but perhaps
    it is my paranoia grasping at straws. Should we take caution, commander? We will
    defer to your preference.
