  sentences:
  - "You needn\u2019t grovel further, Dernoth. Name your demands, and then provide
    this information you claim is so vital."
  - 'But of course, and so it will be readily provided! Before I put forth my requests,
    as I am generous myself. '
  - "Now, listen here. To our south is a smaller post, but it is not of great concern.
    However, it will call on its allies upon sighting you, no doubt about that. \r"
  - 'The path to the stronghold of Borgham is guarded by a camp far to the west of
    here. If you just head straight west of Coilleshire, and tread the northern path
    through the dead garrison, you will find a weakly defended Atlesian camp.

'
  - ' I assure you, they will not expect you. And I believe a larger one is not far
    from that one. If you do this, the line of supply to Borgham will be cut, and
    the Atlesians will have a much harder time defending their holdings. '
  - "Ingva looks a bit surprised and nods attentively, considering the thief\u2019s
    words. Gotfried, who was previously disinterested, furrows his brow upon realizing
    that Dernoth knew more than he let on. "
  - 'Hartwig grins, feeling that his suggestion to show mercy to this strange vagrant
    was validated. '
