  - 'My apologies for the ruckus, Altgardian. But this sniveling thief has slinked
    all the way from Alnor town to here, stealing and cheating all he comes across. '
  - But we were forewarned, and he has blundered into our trap. May you turn him
    over to us so that he may face justice?
  - 'W-wait! Before you act hastily, noble Altgardian, know that my travels have
    gleaned much of the Atlesian dominion. If you defend me from these ruffians,
    and let me be on my way . . . I can make it worth your while! '
  - "Oh good. Now he\u2019s bargaining. You make for a better jester than a thief,
    it would seem. "
  - No! No jests, no japes! The information I hold could be of great use to your
    war effort!
  - Ingva shrugs.
  - "Mayhaps he speaks the truth. But this could be another attempt to swindle us.
