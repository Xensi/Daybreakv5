      the west of here. If you just head straight west of Coilleshire, and tread
      the northern path through the dead garrison, you will find a weakly defended
      Atlesian camp.

  - sentence: ' I assure you, they will not expect you. And I believe a larger one
      is not far from that one. If you do this, the line of supply to Borgham will
      be cut, and the Atlesians will have a much harder time defending their holdings. '

      brow upon realizing that Dernoth knew more than he let on. "
