  - 'Was that your great revelation? This intelligence could be gleaned by amateur
    falconers and hunters, let alone a scout. If you want something from us, you
    should do better than that. '
  - "Ah, so you drive a hard bargain. Alright, alright. I\u2019ll concede to your
    demanding appetite for information. I only have so much information for Borgham,
    but I <i>can</i> tell you that most Mauklendi are none too happy to work for
    the castle garrison. "
  - "And yes, I know what you\u2019ll say, this comes as no surprise. But consider:
    Agents who work on your behalf from the <i>inside</i> of the castle are a boon
    for any siege . . . is it not?"
  - 'And lastly, on a grander scale, I can tell you that the Atlesians will not be
    content to merely defend against your assaults for very long. Soon, they will
    plan to strike out from Grafton, launching attacks of a scale that we have not
    seen since the beginning of this war a year or so prior. '
