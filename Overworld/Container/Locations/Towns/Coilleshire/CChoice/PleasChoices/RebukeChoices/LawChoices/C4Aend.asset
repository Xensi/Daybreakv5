  sentences:
  - Hold on a moment now. Did I say we were going to hear him out? He is a thief
    after all, and thieves should be handled appropriately.
  - "It seems as though this Dernoth will be going through many emotions at once
    today. Hartwig sighs with some regret, whereas Gotfried chuckles amusedly. Even
    Ingva seems to smile. \r\n"
  - "\rDernoth squeals and flails as your guards put manacles around his wrists.
    He will face justice, just not Maukland\u2019s justice. \r\n"
  - '(You arrested Dernoth. Bring him to the Forward Camp for judgement.)
