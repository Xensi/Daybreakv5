  sentences:
  - 'After a small bout of confusion spreads through your ranks as to why your column
    has stopped, they begin preparing for combat as ordered. They gather in their
    neat formations, and they watch their surroundings closely. '
  - The twittering birdsongs are carried by the wind, and they continue to whistle
    as you wonder whether your paranoia got the better of you. Your forces march,
    armed and ready, awaiting a foe that has yet to materialize.
  - "<i>After a few minutes of tense silence, Gotfried clicks his tongue.</i>\nIt
    seems I owe Ingva a drink. Her bet was right, look over there.\r"
  - You narrow your eyes and squint to see a brief glint of light in the northern
    field, gone as quickly as it had flashed. The whistles of birds seem to grow
    louder. Only then, you notice that there is a lack of birds to accompany them.
  - "Somebody\u2019s rummaging about over there!"
  - A head lifts itself from the wheat, revealing a wide brimmed hat and a pitchfork.
  - '<i>Your subordinate lets out a nervous laugh.</i>

    Nevermind. Just a Maukling,
    sir! '
  - "<i>Ingva\u2019s eyes narrow and she turns to you without a beat of hesitation.</i>\nHave
    the bowmen shoot the farmer.\r\n"
  - "<i>Hartwig\u2019s mouth falls agape.\r</i>\nWh\u2014are you mad!?\r\n"
  - Do it.
  - "<i>Your mercenary companion mutters something under his breath:</i>\n\u201CJust
    like the goblins\u2026\u201D"
  - The farmer raises his hand, gripping something tightly.
