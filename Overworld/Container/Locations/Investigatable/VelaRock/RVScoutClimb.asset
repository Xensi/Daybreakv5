  sentences:
  - Some things are better left to your underlings. It's what they're here for.
  - You ask for a volunteer. Without much trouble, they scrabble up the top of the
    rocky hill.
  - They spend a few minutes at the top surveying the landscape.
  - Then, they return to give you their report.
  - "Westward, there\u2019s another town under Atlesian control. To the southwest
    is a camp where they appear to be training soldiers. I bet they won\u2019t be
    too prepared for us if we strike there."
  - "South of that camp is Castle Borgham. Looks like they have a moat. No way we\u2019re
    going to be crossing that unless we take the bridge.\r"
  - "To our southeast is another Atlesian camp. I\u2019ll bet they\u2019ll put up
    more of a fight than the southwest camp. \r"
  - "To the south of that camp, there\u2019s a mill. If we\u2019re strapped for supplies,
    we could head there.\r\n"
  - You thank the scout and mull over the information they've given you.
